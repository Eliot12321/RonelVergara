    <p>Hi, My name is <strong> Ronel M. Vergara </strong>, I live in <strong>Bahayang Pilipino, Sabang Lipa City</strong> and I'm happily living in my life for 20 years and still counting. My mother's name is <strong> Luzviminda M. Vergara</strong> and my father's name is <strong> Francisco R. Vergara </strong>, who passed away last December 23, 2020. I'm former varsity at <strong> The Mabini </strong></p>
    <p>Now I'm taking <strong> Bachelor of Science in  Criminology</strong> at the  <strong> Kolehiyo ng Lungsod ng Lipa </strong> , because I want to pursue my dream and be a good police, And I'm a part timer at the <strong> Green Leaf Garden Resort</strong>, I work their for almost 2 years as a waiter. My life is so confusing, because in my birth certificate my biological mother is my sister, so many of my friends confused when they ask me who is my mother. That's my life so confusing HAHAHAHAHA </p>
    <p></p>
  
    <h1>Ronel's Hobby</h1> 

    <h1> Basketball</h1> <img src="https://scontent.fmnl6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/271383782_349898673236937_2536127194427370356_n.png?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ae9488&_nc_eui2=AeHwpVfgNLfWDtCPC1un3YIEgJZaVOtKem2AllpU60p6bUW_1I3NfmJfDWNUSkB0Nm6p0MGqz1TabkK5pkGnREw3&_nc_ohc=aOr1d7HdA8gAX9lqdva&_nc_ht=scontent.fmnl6-1.fna&oh=03_AVJOVI6vi64Vkk7-ngX8ZA78YWiRzKjVdu70Fvi2RLR76g&oe=61FF9EDF"alt="blank">
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is <strong>Basketball</strong> because of my height, strength and my jumping ability so i easily block them or they can't shoot in front of me. I can dominate other players or opponent in the court. As well as being a great way to stay fit, basketball can also: help you to make new friends and see them regularly teach you about being a good team player. be played by people of all ages and all abilities. be played all year round because it's usually an indoor sport </p>

    <h1> Cycling</h1> <img src="https://scontent.fmnl6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/269891348_512451866708127_6317503639120397944_n.png?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ae9488&_nc_eui2=AeFillViYvtIgekfQN0eA4a27TTsL9HolPvtNOwv0eiU-8UFfcY2TKXiXRPpGmop1mr2mnERtjN_zc5G4iRdZNxw&_nc_ohc=9jryXCm1hFkAX9HEnkz&_nc_ht=scontent.fmnl6-1.fna&oh=03_AVIyxSvU5RTBP8G-LbBwLcEvHwMi8IG1Z4a6gqsSzXKdaQ&oe=61FD990F"alt="blank">
    <p>The great thing about riding a bike is the fact that it gets you out and about exploring new places be they local or further afield, many of which you may not have even known existed if you hadn't  explored them on two wheels. It's amazing how many people say that they have found beautiful new spots really close to their homes when cycling that they had never had reason to stumble across before. </p>
